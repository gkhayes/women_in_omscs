## Installation
The code contained in this repository was written entirely in R and requires the following libraries: plyr, tools, ggplot2 and psych.

## Project Overview


## File Descriptions
All analysis is contained in the following R markdown files:
- **combined_analysis.RMD**: combined analysis of all course survey data;
- **kbai_analysis.RMD**: analysis of KBAI course survey and grade data alone;
- **edutech_analysis.RMD**: analysis of EduTech course survey and grade data alone;
- **hci_analysis.RMD**: analysis of HCI course survey and grade data alone; and
- **survey_analysis.RMD**: analysis of supplementary survey data.

For confidentiality reasons, the data required to run these files has not been included in this repository. However, the output generated from running these files has been included in the form of pdf files with the same file names as those listed above.

A complete list of all questions asked as part of the supplementary survey is contained in **Survey Questions.pdf**.

## Results

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
This analysis was completed as my final project for the Spring 2017 offering of [CS6460 Educational Technology](http://omscs6460.gatech.edu/), as part of the OMSCS program. The grade and course survey data used in this analysis was collected and provided by Dr David Joyner between Summer 2015 and Fall 2016, while the supplementary survey data was collected by me via a survey of self-selected, past and present OMSCS students, conducted online between March 23, 2017 and April 14, 2017.
